# SnowSeeker
This is a basic learning project to create an app that helps users browse ski resorts around the world. It is designed to help users find a resort suitable for their next holiday. The app showcases a list of resorts and their detailed information, optimized for both iPhone and iPad with side-by-side views for larger screens. Additionally, it explores advanced layout problem-solving, improved ways to present alerts, and more.

The source learning is from the 19th project of the course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
